## Requirements

## Python Scripts

*    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
*    All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
*    All your files should end with a new line
*    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
*    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
*    Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
*    All your files must be executable
*    The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Python Test Cases

*    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
*    All your files should end with a new line
*    All your test files should be inside a folder tests
*    All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
*    All your tests should be executed by using this command: **python3 -m doctest ./tests/testfile.txt**
*    All your modules should have a documentation **(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')**
*    All your classes should have a documentation **(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')**
*    All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation **(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'** and **python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')**
*    We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case

### [0. Read file](./0-read_file.py)
* Write a function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout:

*    Prototype: **def read_file(filename=""):**
*    You must use the with statement
*    You don’t need to manage file permission or file doesn't exist exceptions.
*    You are not allowed to import any module

```

#!/usr/bin/python3
read_file = __import__('0-read_file').read_file

read_file("my_file_0.txt")
